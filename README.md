# Realize MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server providing read and write access to Taboola's Realize API. Enables AI assistants to analyze campaigns, retrieve performance data, generate reports, and manage campaigns and items through natural language. Runs as a Streamable HTTP server with OAuth 2.1 — connect to the hosted server, no local install required.

## Quick Start

Connect to the hosted Realize MCP server using [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) transport with OAuth 2.1. Multi-user, stateless, no local install required.

Every client below connects to the same URL, `https://mcp.realize.com/mcp`, and authenticates
the same way: on first use it opens a browser to Taboola SSO, and the resulting bearer token is
what the Realize tools run as.

Pick the section for your client:

### Claude Desktop and claude.ai

Realize is listed in Claude's connector directory, so you can add it without typing a URL.

**Option 1 — from the connector directory (recommended):**

1. Go to Settings → Connectors and browse the available connectors
2. Find **Realize** and select **Connect**
3. A browser window will open to Taboola SSO—enter your credentials to obtain a bearer token used by Realize tools

**Option 2 — as a custom connector:**

Use this if you need to point Claude at a different Realize MCP endpoint.

1. Go to Settings → Connectors → Add Custom Connector
2. Enter the MCP Server name and URL: `https://mcp.realize.com/mcp`
3. Select **Connect** to initiate the OAuth 2.1 flow
4. A browser window will open to Taboola SSO—enter your credentials to obtain a bearer token used by Realize tools

### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http realize-mcp https://mcp.realize.com/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to trigger the OAuth flow.

### Codex

```bash
codex mcp add realize-mcp --url https://mcp.realize.com/mcp
```

Codex detects that the server requires OAuth and starts the flow for you. To re-authenticate
later, run `codex mcp login realize-mcp`.

`codex mcp add` writes the entry to `~/.codex/config.toml`, so Codex Desktop picks it up as
well — restart it after adding. To write the entry by hand instead:

```toml
[mcp_servers.realize-mcp]
url = "https://mcp.realize.com/mcp"
```

### Cursor

Add the server to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "realize-mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.realize.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Cursor's cloud/web agents are supported too — they complete the same OAuth flow through
Cursor's own hosted callback, with nothing to register in advance.

### Other MCP clients

Any client that speaks Streamable HTTP can connect with the server URL alone:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "realize-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.realize.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Your client registers itself automatically on first connect, so there is nothing to set up
beforehand — no client ID to request from Taboola, no callback port to pin, and no bridge
process such as `mcp-remote`. Whichever callback your client uses, a local port or its own
hosted URL, is accepted as-is.

## Tools Reference

### Account Management

**`search_accounts`** — Search accounts by numeric ID or text query. **Call this first** to get `account_id` values needed by all other tools. Results include `currency`, `country`, and `time_zone_name` so the LLM can pick the right budget amounts and timezone.

```
query        (string, optional)            Digit-only = exact ID lookup; text = fuzzy name lookup; leave empty to list all accounts
page         (integer, default: 1)         min: 1
page_size    (integer, default: 10)        min: 1, max: 10 (hard cap)
```

### Campaign Management

A campaign holds budget, bidding, schedule, and targeting. It contains items.

**`list_campaigns`** — List campaigns for an account (one page per call).

```
account_id   (string, required)
page         (integer, default: 1)         min: 1
page_size    (integer, default: 10)        min: 1, max: 10 (hard cap)
```

**`get_campaign`** — Get specific campaign details.

```
account_id   (string, required)
campaign_id  (string, required)
```

**`get_campaign_reach_estimate`** — Estimate reach for a hypothetical campaign configuration before launch. Forecast from targeting + optional bid/budget, not from historical performance. Returns lower/upper bounds for impressions and/or monthly unique users.

```
account_id        (string, required)
campaign          (object, required)              Same targeting blocks as create_campaign / update_campaign below. Reach narrows as more inputs are added: targeting only → audience reach; + cpc (pricing_model=CPC) → narrowed by bid competitiveness; + spending_limit or daily_cap → additionally capped by impressions the budget can afford.
estimation_types  (array of string, optional)     IMPRESSIONS | MONTHLY_USERS — omit for both
```

#### Campaign write tools (`create_campaign`, `update_campaign`)

Both tools accept the same scalars and targeting blocks. Scalars partial-merge; targeting blocks full-replace within block. New campaigns ship paused unless `is_active=true` is sent.

Required differs:

```
create_campaign:  account_id, name, marketing_objective, branding_text, spending_limit_model, bid_strategy
update_campaign:  account_id, campaign_id
```

Scalars (all optional on update; the create-required ones above are mandatory on create):

```

cpc                      (number)             Bid amount in account's default currency (per-click for CPC; per-1000-viewable-impressions for VCPM)
cpa_goal                 (number)             Target cost per acquisition (TARGET_CPA only)

### Discovery

Use these to populate campaign and item targeting fields with valid values.

**`search_geos`** — Countries, regions, DMAs, cities, postal codes. Returns `{code, name}` pairs; use the `code` field for targeting.

```
dimension     (string enum, required)       countries | regions | dma | cities | postal_codes
country_code  (string)                      Required for regions / dma / cities / postal_codes
```

**`search_techno`** — OS versions and browsers.

```
dimension  (string enum, required)          operating_system_versions | browsers
os_family  (string)                         Required for operating_system_versions
```

**`search_audiences`** — First-party and custom audiences for an account.

```
account_id              (string, required)
country_codes           (string)
country_targeting_type  (string enum)       ALL | INCLUDE | EXCLUDE
```

**`search_lookalike_audiences`** — CRM / pixel / PBP lookalike audiences.

```
account_id    (string, required)
country_code  (string)
```

**`search_contextual_segments`** — Contextual segments.

```
account_id              (string, required)
country_codes           (string)
country_targeting_type  (string enum)       ALL | INCLUDE | EXCLUDE
```

**`search_publishers`** — Publishers an account may target.

```
account_id     (string, required)
query          (string, required)
publisher_ids  (array)
page           (integer, default: 1)        min: 1
page_size      (integer, default: 10)       min: 1, max: 50
```

**`get_conversion_rules`** — Read an account's conversion rules. Omit `rule_id` for all of them; the returned IDs populate `conversion_rules.rules: [{id}]` on `create_campaign` / `update_campaign`. Not paginated — one call returns every rule in full.

```
account_id  (string, required)
rule_id     (string)                      Omit for all rules; set (numeric id as a string) to narrow to one. Empty string is rejected — omit it entirely
```

**`search_conversion_rules`** — **Deprecated alias of `get_conversion_rules`**, kept so existing callers keep working; identical behaviour. Scheduled for removal after **2026-11-01** — switch to `get_conversion_rules`.

**`list_time_zones`** — IANA time-zone names for `activity_schedule.time_zone`. No parameters.

**`list_cta_types`** — `cta.cta_type` values for `create_native_item` / `update_native_item`. No parameters.

### Reporting (CSV Format)

All report tools return CSV with a summary header. Every report requires these parameters:

```
account_id  (string, required)            From search_accounts
start_date  (string, required)            Format: YYYY-MM-DD
end_date    (string, required)            Format: YYYY-MM-DD
```

Paginated reports also accept:

```
page        (integer, default: 1)         min: 1
page_size   (integer, default: 20)        min: 1, max: 100
```

Some reports also support sorting and filtering:

```
sort_field      (string enum)             clicks | spent | impressions
sort_direction  (string enum, default: DESC)   ASC | DESC
filters         (object)                  JSON object with string values only
```

**`get_top_campaign_content_report`** — Top performing campaign content.
Supports: shared params only. Not paginated and not sortable — returns the full result set in a single call, fixed-sorted by revenue DESC (the `spent` column), capped at top 1000 server-side.

**`get_campaign_breakdown_report`** — Campaign performance breakdown.
Supports: shared params + pagination + sort + filters.

**`get_campaign_history_report`** — Historical campaign data.
Supports: shared params + pagination (no sort, no filters).

**`get_campaign_site_day_breakdown_report`** — Site/day performance breakdown.
Supports: shared params + pagination + sort + filters.

#### Data grain & interpretation

Reports return flattened rows. Each report has a fixed **row grain** (the composite key that makes a row unique). The same `site_id` can appear under several campaigns, so rows must be read at their grain — not merged by a single id. Column names below are the literal CSV headers (note: campaign id is `campaign` in the performance reports but `campaign_id` in the history report).

```
get_campaign_breakdown_report             campaign
get_campaign_site_day_breakdown_report    (campaign, site_id, date)
get_top_campaign_content_report           (campaign, item)
get_campaign_history_report               (campaign_id, change_time, id)   # audit log, not metrics
```

Don't rely on column position — grain/key columns aren't guaranteed to lead or be adjacent. Each response names the row key explicitly on a `Row key:` line, the authoritative set of columns that makes a row unique.

**Metrics are computed server-side** (performance reports only). `ctr`, `cpc`, `cpm`, `cpa`, `cvr`, `roas` are pre-computed per row — read them as-is. Do not recompute or average them across rows. To aggregate volume, sum only the raw counters (`clicks`, `impressions`, `spent`).

**`get_campaign_history_report` is a change/audit log**, not a performance report — one row per change event (`change_type`, `old_value`→`new_value`, `performer`). It has no impression/click/spend or rate metrics.

**Cross-account:** reports are scoped to the single `account_id` queried and do not roll up child accounts; query each child account separately. Campaign/site/item ids are globally unique, so no account column is needed in the grain.

**Rules for correct numbers:**
- The `Total` in the summary line is authoritative — do not sum rows across pages to derive totals or rates.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```
User: "Show me campaigns for Marketing Corp"
AI:
  1. Searches accounts for "Marketing Corp"
  2. Retrieves campaigns using the found account_id
  3. Returns campaign list with performance metrics
```

**Important**: All operations require getting `account_id` values from `search_accounts` first - never use numeric IDs directly.

### Find Account and List Campaigns

```
User: "Show campaigns for account 12345"
AI Process:
  Step 1: search_accounts("12345") → Returns account_id: "advertiser_12345_prod"
  Step 2: get_all_campaigns(account_id="advertiser_12345_prod")
  Result: List of campaigns with details
```

### Get Performance Report

```
User: "Get campaign performance for Marketing Corp last month"
AI Process:
  Step 1: search_accounts("Marketing Corp") → account_id: "mktg_corp_001"
  Step 2: get_campaign_breakdown_report(
    account_id="mktg_corp_001",
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-31"
  )
  Result: CSV report with campaign metrics
```

### Top Performing Content

```
User: "Show top 20 performing content items"
AI Process:
  get_top_campaign_content_report(
    account_id="account_id_from_search",
    start_date="2024-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-31",
    page_size=20,
    sort_field="spent",
    sort_direction="DESC"
  )
  Result: Top content sorted by spend
```

### Update a Campaign Budget

```
User: "Bump the daily cap on Marketing Corp's Spring Sale campaign to $500"
AI Process:
  Step 1: search_accounts("Marketing Corp") → account_id: "mktg_corp_001"
  Step 2: list_campaigns(account_id="mktg_corp_001") → find Spring Sale → campaign_id: "12345678"
  Step 3: update_campaign(
    account_id="mktg_corp_001",
    campaign_id="12345678",
    daily_cap=500
  )
  Result: Campaign updated; other fields and targeting untouched
```

### Estimate Reach Before Launch

```
User: "How many people could we reach on desktop in the US for Marketing Corp?"
AI Process:
  Step 1: search_accounts("Marketing Corp") → account_id: "mktg_corp_001"
  Step 2: get_campaign_reach_estimate(
    account_id="mktg_corp_001",
    campaign={
      "country_targeting": {"type": "INCLUDE", "value": ["US"]},
      "platform_targeting": {"type": "INCLUDE", "value": ["DESK"]}
    },
    estimation_types=["IMPRESSIONS", "MONTHLY_USERS"]
  )
  Result: Lower/upper bound estimates for impressions and monthly unique users
```

### Create a Native Item

```
User: "Add a new ad to campaign 12345678 pointing at example.com/landing — headline 'Save 20% This Spring', body 'Limited-time offer on all spring collection items.', thumbnail https://cdn.example.com/spring.jpg, Shop Now CTA"
AI Process:
  Step 1: search_accounts(...) → account_id: "mktg_corp_001"
  Step 2: list_cta_types() → confirm "SHOP_NOW" is a valid cta_type
  Step 3: create_native_item(
    account_id="mktg_corp_001",
    campaign_id="12345678",
    url="https://example.com/landing",
    title="Save 20% This Spring",
    description="Limited-time offer on all spring collection items.",
    thumbnail_url="https://cdn.example.com/spring.jpg",
    cta={"cta_type": "SHOP_NOW"}
  )
  Result: Native item created
```
